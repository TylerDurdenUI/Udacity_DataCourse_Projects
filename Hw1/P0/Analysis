Taks0: O(1).
In Python lists, values are assigned to and retrieved from specific, known memory locations. No matter how large the list is, index lookup and assignment take a constant amount of time and are thus O ( 1 ) O(1) O(1).


Taks1: O(n).
Need to iterate through lists once.


Task2: O(n)
Need to iterate through lists once.

Task3: O(n log(n))
Python sorted function time complexity O(n log(n)), and for loop here is O(n). Combine them together, we will get O(n log(n)).

Task4: O(n log(n))
Python sorted function time complexity O(n log(n)), and for loop here is O(n). Combine them together, we will get O(n log(n)).
